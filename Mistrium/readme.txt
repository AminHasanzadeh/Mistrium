Mistrium front end project

Here is my first project that followed by UI design and its files .
A web template for a furniture shop named mistrium . full UIed .
I got this template from arshakir.com .
I choosed this one because this is easy as a beginner . but result is pretty cool and pro !
used with html5 tags and its seo friendly .
main photo is in root directory .

	this is NOT responsive . i didnt have sketches for phone size
	and this is just for exercise .

	Hope you liked that ;)
